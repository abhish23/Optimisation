Particle Swarm Optimisation:

PSO have many advantages such as comparitive simplicity, rapid convergence and little parameters
to be adjusted. It has been used in many field such as mechanical, chemical, aerospace
design etc. The particle swarm algorithm is an optimisation technique inspired by the metaphor
of social interaction observed among insects or animals. The kind of social interaction modelled
within a PSO is used to guide a population of individuals (particles) moving toward the
most promising area of the search space. In a PSO algorithm, each particle is a candidate
solution and each particle flies through the search space, depending on two important factors:
the best position the current particle have found so far and the global best position identified
from the entire population. The rate of change in positions of particle is given by its velocity.

Particles velocity and positions are updated related to the pbest and gbest values. 
PSO Search Domain
Here, xi(t) is the position of particle at time t,
vi(t) is the velocity by which it is moving in current direction,
Pi(t) is the personal best location of a particle,and
gi(t) is the global or teams best location.
So, the particle will first move into its current location and then towards it personal best location
and then after its global best location. After all this movement finally the particle will rest in a
better position than earlier. Likewise, the whole bunch of particles move together and until ones
find the destination.
For updating the position,
Xi(t+1) = Xi(t) + Vi(t+1)
Vi(t+1) = wVi(t) + c1(Pi(t)-Xi(t)) + c2(g(t)- Xi(t))
Standard Scalar Particle Swarm Optimisation:
Vij(t+1) = wVij(t)+r1c1(Pij(t)-Xij(t)) +r2c2(g(t)-Xij(t))
where r1 and r2 are random numbers range[0,1],
c1 and c2 are acceleration coefficients,
w is inertia coefficient,
wVij(t) is inertia,
r1c1(Pij(t)-Xij(t)) is Cognitive Component, and
r2c2(g(t)-Xij(t)) is Social Component
