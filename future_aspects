The traditional approach for solving Travelling Salesman Problem is computationally difficult
for increasing number of stops whereas Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO), Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm can easily solve Travelling Salesman Problem for a large number of stops. This proves that how swarm intelligence has acted as
an inspiration paradigm for solving an optimisation problem.
Artificial Bee Colony works on the waggle dance to find food sources while Particle Swarm
Optimisation works on global best position. Also, Artificial Bee Colony needs at least ten to
thirty execution cycle to give better outcome while PSO does the work in one execution cycle.
Location of cities is treated as food sources, where one by one each and every city are visited
in the search domain of respective algorithm and avoiding repetition.
The code shows the best efficiency over LINUX platform as compared to Windows and MAC
OS. Although, Particle Swarm Optimisation has worked faster than ABC a little change in a
parameter can drastically affect the working of these algorithms. The best algorithm is yet to
come as several variants of ABC, PSO and ABC are still under research. Proper parameters
and topology selection are also one of the research areas. It has become a major concern for
researchers as it provides a vast domain to work. Ant Colony Optimisation, Particle Swarm
Optimisation and artificial bee colony algorithms are heuristic global optimisation which is also
used in various real-life applications.Although ABC has great potential, it was clear to the scientific community that some modifications to the original structure are still necessary in order
to significantly improve its performance. And also ABC can be used as an evolutionary framework into which different traditional or modern heuristic algorithmic components are integrated.
ABC can be also applied for optimization in dynamic and uncertain environments.
