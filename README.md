# Optimisation
Every individual has an ability to interact mutually, which is one of the fundamental social behavior present from humans to insects. This social interaction increases the rate of adaptation and improve faster than biological evolution. The project implements these major driving concepts of optimization algorithm. For every problem there must be an optimal and feasible solution in order to be optimized. While dealing with number of algorithms per day, selecting an algorithm to implement in our problem domain is difficult. Therefore, this project depicts different optimization algorithms and their implementation in Travelling Salesman Problem. It will also depicts how different environment affects the efficiency of these optimization algorithms and their implementation in respective area of applications.This project includes a comparative study of different optimization algorithms (i.e. Ant Colony Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization and Artificial Bee Colony) on Travelling Salesman Problem in hetrogeneous environments.
